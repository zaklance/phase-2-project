                        Architecture is built by directions; you follow a set of drawings to
                        construct a building. These directions or construction documents
                        go from highly notated details, the standard in the US, to incredibly
                        vague construction documents that take means and methods to
                        a whole other level commonly found in India. In the United States
                        the expertise lies in the architect, but in India, we find the building
                        experts (technically) end up being the construction workers. So who
                        becomes the author of the building?
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Many buildings derive their significance in the end product. However,
                        some find their inherent value in the process through which they
                        were crafted, like a first of some variety. Inevitably, this questions the
                        importance of how it was made v. why it was made; process v. end
                        product.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In this case, the process resulted in a bell curve polytypic creations;
                        adhering to an overarching design aesthetic with a few outliers. The
                        results are potentially a blend of qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative
                        being the common traits that are derived from the directives, and
                        qualitative being the ipseity resulting from the individual that created
                        the end product.

                        In the end, architecture that we see is built by a person interpreting
                        a series of directions and operating as such. Directions in architecture,
                        generally, aim to find the sweet spot between all-knowing
                        and fill-in-the-rest, specific enough to illustrate the concept while
                        making sure the building won’t leak, but sufficiently vague to save
                        time and alleviate legal ramifications through means and methods.
                        What happens when we further abstract the level of instruction? Add
                        another hand through which the conception passes; Conceptual
                        Designer / Architecture Firm / Contractor. This process is similar to
                        the standard found in firms, Lead Designer / Licensed Architect /
                        Contractor, but the complete removal of the conceptual from the
                        fabrication conversation brings an unseen level of abstraction to each
                        directive. Ownership of the final product becomes ubiquitous, with
                        the conceptualization evolving with every reinterpretation;
                        Conceptualizer / Interpreter / Realist. By presenting the architect with
                        a short set of directives we end up with room for individual intervention
                        while framing a sense of ipseity in the end creation.

                        Under the current circumstances and with a sample crowd of my
                        current size (with them being as busy as they are) it is required for
                        myself be an operator in some of the directives. My actions are
                        designed primarily to reduce the amount of time the sample group
                        spends on the directives and to maximize the amount of responses
                        under such short time frames. Additionally, I clean up the files and
                        organize them for analysis and prepare them for the next iteration of
                        actions. To distance myself, some mild algorithmic design is used
                        as a means of neutralizing my own guiding hand and subconscious
                        ideals. These actions are intended to be light, with steps that encourage
                        unforeseen randomness while not being entirely unexpected—
                        just like all the other directives.

                        Designers often find refuge with mistranslation in the design process,
                        a purposeful abstraction of something found in nature, perhaps. But
                        is this mistranslating or reinterpreting? The process of reading and
                        following directions, however strict, explanatory, concise—or not,
                        cannot compete with the human attention span or the absence of
                        visual reference to create something visible. Any number of factors
                        can affect the resulting object; preconceived notions of what the
                        outcome might be, current mood, visual stimuli experienced that day,
                        week, or any number of infinite variables. Despite all of that, however,
                        the collection of outcomes do share a common language that is
                        clearly derived from the directive. And so we find that the beauty lies
                        somewhere between cohesion and the outcast.

                        When results supersede speculation, at some point, restraint needs
                        to rein in on the complex. Expression must become diluted by
                        excess for such a discovery to occur. An unyielding volume accompanied
                        with wild unheading voids apparently reaches this grotesque
                        moment. Counteract and re-interpolate the forms with a concise grid
                        composed of pure geometry, juxtapose the omnidirectional with that
                        of the predictable. Objectively conforming all the voids unifies both
                        the identity of the volume and the openings, and suddenly the two
                        the two languages, lacking ownership, may confide in each other.
